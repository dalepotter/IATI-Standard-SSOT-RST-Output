      - generated-datetime
      - A date/time stamp for when this file was generated. This
        is not necessarily the last-updated date for the
        individual activity records in it. Use of this attribute
        is highly recommended, to allow recipients to know when a
        file has been updated.

      - linked-data-default
      - If a publisher chooses to publish linked data about their
        IATI activities then allowing them to declare where this
        data is published would support discovery of it, and any
        additional information they may choose to publish as
        Linked Data alongside it.
        
        This attribute is a URI path upon which an activity
        identifier can be appended to get a differentiable URI
        for any activity contained within a file.
        
        Where a publisher declares using one of these properties
        that authoritative linked data is accessible for an
        activity then consuming applications that are generating
        Linked Data from an IATI XML file should assert an
        owl:sameAs relationship to the relevant URI.

        International Aid Transparency Initiative: Activity-Information Schema
  
        Release 2.03, 2018-02-19
  
        NOTE: the xml.xsd and iati-common.xsd schemas must be in the
        same directory as this one.
  
        This W3C XML Schema defines an XML document type for information
        about one or more aid-related activities, following the standard
        published at http://iatistandard.org/
  
        This document type may be extended with additional elements and
        attributes, but they must belong to an explicit XML namespace.
