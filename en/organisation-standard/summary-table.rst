        years is reported. The status explains whether the budget being reported
        is indicative or has been formally committed. The value should appear

        element. The sum of budget-line values does not have to

      - The recipient-org-budget element allows for the reporting of
        forward looking budgets for each institution which receives
        core funding from the reporting organisation. The
        recommendation is that, where and when possible, annual
        planned budgets for each recipient institution for each of the
        next three financial years are reported. This is primarily
        applicable to donors but any provider of core funding is
        expected to use it. Earmarked budgets should be reported at
        activity-level through the Activity Standard. The status
        explains whether the budget being reported is indicative or
        has been formally committed. The value should appear within
        the BudgetStatus codelist. If the @status attribute is not
        present, the budget is assumed to be indicative.

      - The recipient-region-budget element allows for the reporting of forward
        looking budgets where the organisation maintains region-wide, rather than
        or in addition to country-specific budgets. The recommendation is that,
        where and when possible, the organisation’s total annual planned budget
        for each of the next three financial years is reported for each recipient
        region. This must NOT include an aggregation of budgets reported in the
        recipient-country-budget element. It is strongly recommended that
        publishers report to existing defined regions wherever possible. The
        status explains whether the budget being reported is indicative or has
        been formally committed. The value should appear within the BudgetStatus
        codelist. If the @status attribute is not present, the budget is assumed
        to be indicative.

        International Aid Transparency Initiative: Organisation-Information Schema
  
        Release 2.03, 2018-02-19
  
        NOTE: the xml.xsd and iati-common.xsd schemas must be in the
        same directory as this one.
  
        This W3C XML Schema defines an XML document type for information
        about an aid organisation, following the standard published at
        http://iatistandard.org
  
        This document type may be extended with additional elements and
        attributes, but they must belong to an explicit XML namespace.
