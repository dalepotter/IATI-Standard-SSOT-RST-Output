Budgets
=======

Definition
----------
Within the **IATI organisation standard** three types of *budgets* can be declared.  

These all relate to the specific ``iati-organisation`` being described:

* ``total-budget`` - total annual planned budget of the ``iati-organisation``.
* ``recipient-org-budget`` - budget for disbursements to another organisation.
* ``recipient-country-budget`` -  budget for each country in which the ``iati-organisation`` operates.


Considerations
--------------
When using the **IATI organisation standard** to declare *budgets*, the following should be considered:

* It is recommended that budgets in the **IATI organisation standard** are forward-looking.
* It is recommended, where possible, that budgets are presented for the next three financial years.
* When presenting multiple budgets, then the relevant ``budget`` element should be repeated accordingly.
* It is possible to report periods other than financial years, but this is not recommended.
* Financial periods are presented using the ``period-start`` and ``period-end`` dates.
* It is expected that financial years appropriate to the relevant ``iati-organisation`` would be described.
* It is strongly recommended that the ``period-start`` and ``period-end`` of the financial years described for any ``recipient-country-budget`` match the budgetary/planning cycle of the ``recipient-country``.
* It is possible to report budget values in multiple ``@currency``.
* The ``@default-currency`` can be set in the ``iati-organisation`` element.  Should subsequent budgets be in the same ``@currency`` then there is no need to restate.
* When declaring a ``value-date`` for any budget, this date must be in the past.

2.01 Considerations
-------------------
In version 2.01, the following must also be considered:

* The ``budget-line`` element was introduced.
