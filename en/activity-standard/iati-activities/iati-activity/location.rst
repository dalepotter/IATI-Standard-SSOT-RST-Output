Example Usage

	...
	</location>

| Full example with all child elements:

.. literalinclude:: ../../activity-standard-example-annotated.xml

	...
	</location>
	<location ref="KH-PNH">
	...
	</location>

Changelog

^^^^
Note that major changes were made to the subelements of ``location`` in version 1.04.
