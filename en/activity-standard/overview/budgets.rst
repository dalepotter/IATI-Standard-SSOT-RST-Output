Definition
----------
The monetary *budgets* assigned to a specific ``iati-activity`` can be described in the **IATI activity standard** using the following:

* ``transaction-type`` type Commitment (code *2*) can be used to describe the total committed budget for the duration of the activity. Any changes to the original commitment should be reported as additional, incremental transactions (positive or negative) so that the sum of commitments represents the total committed budget.
* ``budget`` - the value of the ``iati-activity`` ``budget`` for each financial year over the lifetime of the activity, as stated in the :underline:`original` project document or :underline:`revised` accordingly. The status explains whether the budget being reported is indicative or has been formally committed. The value should appear within the `BudgetStatus <http://iatistandard.org/203/codelists/BudgetStatus/>`__ codelist. If the @status attribute is not present, the budget is assumed to be indicative. The sum of budgets may or may not match the sum of commitments, depending on a publisherâ€™s business model and legal frameworks.

* ``planned-disbursement`` - a scheduled payment, set up against the ``budget``
 
Additionally, there are two areas within the **IATI activity standard** that allow further clarification of budgets:

* ``country-budget-item`` - alignment of ``iati-activity`` with the functional and administrative classifications used in the ``recipient-country`` Chart of Accounts.
* ``capital-spend`` - the percentage of the total commitment that is for capital spending.

These all relate to the specific ``iati-activity`` being described.  


Considerations
--------------
When using the **IATI activity standard** to declare *budgets*, the following should be considered:

* It is recommended that budgets are presented in financial years.
* A budget must not span a period greater than one year.
* When presenting multiple budgets, then the ``budget`` element should be repeated accordingly.
* It is expected that the financial years for ``reporting-org`` are described.
* It is possible to report periods other than years, but this is not recommended.
* Financial periods can be presented using the ``period-start`` and ``period-end`` dates.
* For ``planned-disbursement`` it is valid to only report the ``period-start`` as a single date.
* It is possible to report budget values in multiple currencies, overriding the default currency set in ``iati-activity``
* It is expected that budgets would be described from the ``reporting-org`` perspective. 
* When declaring a ``value-date`` for any budget, this date must be in the past.

2.01+ Considerations
--------------------
In versions 2.01 and above, the following must also be considered:

* The ``planned-disbursement`` element no longer has an ``@updated`` attribute.  This has been replaced by a ``@type`` attribute
